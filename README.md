# HLGNN Node Classification

This project focuses on **Node Classification** using **Hierarchical Local Graph Neural Networks (HLGNN)**. 

## Features:
- **Hierarchical Local Graph Neural Network (HLGNN)** implementation for effective node classification tasks.
- **Data Reader Utilities** to handle and preprocess graph datasets.
- **Experiments** conducted on datasets like Cora to evaluate the model's performance.

## Documentation

For detailed information on the implementation and experiments, please refer to my [thesis](https://thesis.unipd.it/handle/20.500.12608/68875).
